# LaTeX Snippets for VS Code
These are Visual Studio Code snippets to be used in conjunction with my LaTeX templates package [hrftex](https://github.com/r0uv3n/hrftex) 
and [LaTeX-Workshop for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop). 
Fork (or just download) these into "%AppData%\Code\User\snippets" (or "%AppData%\Code - Insiders\User\snippets" if you are using Visual Studio Code - Insiders).
